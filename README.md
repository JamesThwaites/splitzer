# splitzer

A concept for an autoscrolling platforming game. What if your character could split into two halves (arms and legs) and jump/act separately with each half?

The arms can also grab and hang/swing from the ceiling, because why not ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯?

Try it out on github pages (jamesthwaites.github.io/splitzer)

Created with Two.js
